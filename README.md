project aimed at hosting a prototype website in order to test it


HTML files are split into two main websites, one for normal PC screens and one for mobile sized screens and devices.

All the mobile pages begin with 'm' and have a captital letter at the beginning of each word

The index page is the standard screen start page, where a javascript action will send the user to the mobile page if a smaller device is detected. 'mobile' is like the index page for smaller screens
